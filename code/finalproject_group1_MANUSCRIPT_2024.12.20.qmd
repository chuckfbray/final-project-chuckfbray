# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

The SARS-2 COVID-19 pandemic has been a major cause of death and disability in the United States and globally since the first months of 2020. XXX deaths are reported through time of writing, while millions are suspected to have diminished quality of life from the still poorly-understood set of conditions associated with "long COVID". [[DESCRIBE IMPACT OF PANDEMIC]]. It is popular to describe the net consequences of the pandemic but less so to assess the evolution of the virus and the ability of our public health and medical sectors to respond to the morbidity and mortality it caused.

To this end, it is necessary to provide a conceptualization of the distinct stages of the COVID-19 pandemic as it affected the US population, as well as the relative performance of different areas within the US. This paper aims to describe the changing dynamics of the novel coronavirus as such. [^fn-citation]

# Methods {#sec-methods}

Data were obtained from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) [[data page name]] via API, comprising hospitalizations, deaths, and cases associated with COVID-19 infection and reported weekly at the US state-level.

The study proceeds in three parts. First, the COVID-19 pandemic was split broadly into different phases based on counts of cases, deaths, and hospitalizations across regions of the United States. Following this, the performance of individual US states was described along these measures within each determined wave. Finally, the nature of COVID-19 strains (their virulence and/or strain on hospitals) is determined by comparing the evolution of different measures from early to later waves.

In order to describe the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, a novel approach to defining breakpoints between infection regimes (or "waves" of COVID-19) is developed. DESCRIBE APPROACH HERE. Break least squares as well as Markov Regime Switching (MRS) models were considered (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10847870). Ultimately, the complexity of these models or in the case of MRS constraint to just two regimes motivated the development of this identification strategy. [^fn-citation]
